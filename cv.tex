    \section{\mysidestyle Selected \\ Projects}
\textbf{Design and Optimization of NoC-based Systems For Cyber-physical System(CPS)}  \\ \textit{Jan 2014 - Present}\\
\textit{Published \textbf{8} papers(including \textbf{5} first-author papers)} all on top-tier conferences and journals like \textbf{DAC, CODES+ISSS, ICCAD, TVLSI and NOCS.} \\
\textbf{1.} Developed the first large scale Networks-on-chip (NoC) based manycore accelerator for Protein Folding Simulation that has achieved near-linear speedup (\textbf{DAC 2014}).\\
\textbf{2.} Proposed network bandwidth and resource time-multiplexing approaches for hierarchical parallel genetic algorithm (HPGA) accelerator (\textbf{NOCS 2014}).\\
\textbf{3.} Proposed a user-cooperation based linear network-coding scheme to improve significantly the throughput of collective communication of NoC-based manycore system (\textbf{NOCS 2015}).\\
\textbf{4.} Developed a general mathematical optimization framework for automatic synthesis of on-chip network topology with guaranteed performance bound (\textbf{NOCS 2016}).\\
\textbf{5.} Proposed a complex-network theory based scalable and realistic benchmark synthesis tool using LLVM for performance evaluation of manycore system (\textbf{CODES+ISSS 2016}).

\textbf{Machine-learning based Mathematical Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems}  \\ \textit{July 2015 - Present}\\
\textit{Published \textbf{4} first-author papers} on top-tier conferences and journals including \textbf{DATE, Allerton Conference, ICCPS, TODAES}

\textbf{1.}  Proposed a spatio-temporal fractal dynamical system model capturing the inter-dependencies of muscles involved in forearm movements. Develop a multi-regression algorithm for parameter estimation.(\textbf{DATE 2016})\\
\textbf{2.}  Proposed a mathematical framework investigating the minimum number of sensors to ensure Observability of physiological systems. Proved the feasibility space of the problem is submodular and proposed a greedy-algorithm that delivers solutions with guaranteed optimality. (\textbf{Allerton Conference 2016})\\
\textbf{3.}  Proposed a dynamical graph model for internet-of-things (IoT) that enables the investigation of a set of under-explored key challenges in IoT domain (\textbf{TODAES, accepted to appear}\\
\textbf{4.} Proposed a new mathematical strategy for constructing compact yet accurate fractional-order non-linear models of complex systems dynamics that aim to scrutinize the causal effects and influences by analyzing the statistics of the magnitude increments and the inter-event times of stochastic processes (\textbf{ICCPS}, to appear).
